Implementation planned:
  
  Minor tasks:
    - Make character information scroll with the character image.
    - Add option to show images in a horizontal/vertical row.
    - Gallery mode for screenshots.
    - Filter box for tags so you can pre-filter them before selecting one.
    - User option to set tags as favourite, so it brings them on the top of the list.
    - Color code tags
    
  Medium tasks:
    - Wishlist implementation. Propably in a new window.
    - Cache images locally.
    - Filter by developer, artist, scenario creator, language etc.
    - Set exe paths and create walkthroughs while not connected to vndb.
    
  Major tasks:
    - Implement themes offered by vndb.
    - Add vns with vn name. Propably in conjunction with the changes to the file indexer. Will be a pain...
  
  On Hold:
    - Remember user column reordering and resizing. -> Pretty difficult.
    - Display related visual novels as link, so you can click on them to get to the VNDB page 
      or select the vn if it is already on your list.
    - Change file indexer so it can find VNs by directory name and fetch the info from VNDB.org. -> Was halfway done, but I wasn't happy with it.
    
Current tasks:

  Currently doing:
    My semester has just begun and I don't have time to work on this, so work is onhold probably until I'm finished with my bachelor thesis 
    next year (somewhere in june hopefully...).
      

Done (and not yet released):

    - Fixed a crash that occured if you browsed through the vn list with your arrow keys.

Done (and released):

  Minor:
    - Add scrollbar to vn description window.
    - Remember user tabs so they will be the same when starting the program again.
    - Fixed bug that could crash the program if you had a vn selected and a property was null and you changed the category tab.
    - Fixed problem with the indexer.
    - Make it clear if no character information is found.
    - Added 'No image available' and 'Image is NSFW' images.
    - Images fixed.
    - Window size will be remembered...    
  
  Medium:
    - Parse description text etc. correctly (implement a parser for the VNDB markdown text).
      ->  this is now implemented, it first parses from bbcode to html and then to xaml.
          it just doesn't work very well, as hyperlinks can't be clicked in WPF richtextboxes...
    - Change file indexer so multiple paths to VN directories can be added (e.g. Steam).
    
  Major:
  
    - Emulate VNDB style to characters, on the left side the character image on the right the description.
      ->  Implemented. Works well. Looks better now.
    - Add navigation buttons to screenshots and a number (current picture is X of Y available pictures).
      ->  Not needed anymore.
