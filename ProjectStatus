Implementation planned:
  
  Minor tasks:
    
  Medium tasks:
    - Wishlist implementation. Propably in a new window.
    
  Major tasks:
    
  
Current tasks:

  Currently doing:
    - Add vns with vn name. Propably in conjunction with the changes to the file indexer. Will be a pain...
      
  On Hold:
    - Remember user column reordering and resizing. -> Pretty difficult.
    - Display related visual novels as link, so you can click on them to get to the VNDB page 
      or select the vn if it is already on your list.
    - Change file indexer so it can find VNs by directory name and fetch the info from VNDB.org. -> Was halfway done, but I wasn't happy with it.


Done:

  Minor:
    - Add scrollbar to vn description window.
    - Remember user tabs so they will be the same when starting the program again.
    - Fixed bug that could crash the program if you had a vn selected and a property was null and you changed the category tab.
    - Fixed problem with the indexer.
    - Make it clear if no character information is found.
    - Added 'No image available' and 'Image is NSFW' images.
    - Images fixed.
    - Window size will be remembered...
  
  Medium:
    - Parse description text etc. correctly (implement a parser for the VNDB markdown text).
      ->  this is now implemented, it first parses from bbcode to html and then to xaml.
          it just doesn't work very well, as hyperlinks can't be clicked in WPF richtextboxes...
    - Change file indexer so multiple paths to VN directories can be added (e.g. Steam).
    
  Major:
  
    - Emulate VNDB style to characters, on the left side the character image on the right the description.
      ->  Implemented. Works well. Looks better now.
    - Add navigation buttons to screenshots and a number (current picture is X of Y available pictures).
      ->  Not needed anymore.
