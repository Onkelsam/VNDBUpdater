Implementation planned:
  
  Minor tasks:
    - Change file indexer so multiple paths to VN directories can be added (e.g. Steam).
    - Remember user tabs so they will be the same when starting the program again.
    - Add scroll bar to vn description window.
    - Make it clear if no character information is found.
   
  Medium tasks:
    - Wishlist implementation. Propably in a new window.
    - Display related visual novels as link, so you can click on them to get to the VNDB page 
      or select the vn if it is already on your list.
    - Remember user column reordering and resizing.
    - Parse description text etc. correctly (implement a parser for the VNDB markdown text).
    
  Major tasks:
    - Change file indexer so it can find VNs by directory name and fetch the info from VNDB.org.
    - Emulate VNDB style to characters, on the left side the character image on the right the description.
    - Add navigation buttons to screenshots and a number (current picture is X of Y available pictures).
    - Add vns with vn name. Propably in conjunction with the changes to the file indexer. Will be a pain...
  
  
Current tasks:
  
  Minor tasks:
    - Constant improvements to the codebase through refactoring.
    - Finding bugs and fixing them.
    - Improving the GUI.
    - Resize covers correctly.
